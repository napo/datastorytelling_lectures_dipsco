## description
Data plays a crucial role in modern society, yet it remains exclusive as it requires specific skills for processing, understanding, and representing it effectively.<br/>
Data storytelling is a methodology that utilizes narratives to help readers comprehend a phenomenon by representing and analyzing data. This course aims to teach learners this methodology, enabling them to create websites that use a combination of visualizations and text to tell stories based on data. The goal is to empower readers to independently identify additional
narratives.<br/>
The course will adopt a &quot;hands-on learning&quot; approach, allowing participants to immediately apply the concepts they learn. By the end of the course, individuals will be proficient in crafting data-driven stories and creating web tools to enhance the user experience.
